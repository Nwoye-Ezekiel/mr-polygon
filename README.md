### 🎨 Design Philosophy

The artwork explores emotional expression through geometric abstraction. The cubist-inspired portrait, combined with the somber music and subtle animations, creates an introspective mood. Every element from the blue monochrome palette to the rolling eyes—works together to evoke a sense of quiet contemplation.

The interactive controls ensure each viewer can tailor their experience, making the art accessible and personal.
